# PolariodCameraTimer
Arduino Code for a small timer for a Polaroid timer. Allows for both 3 second and 10 second countdowns.

Pushing the button starts a timer, blinking the LED to let users know the countdown. At the end the light stays on, and then triggers the servo motor to actuate the button on the camera. 


## Hardware

- Arduino Nano (but others would work)
- Servo motor
- 1 LED
- 1 pushbutton
- 3 pin switch

## Pinout (WIP)
